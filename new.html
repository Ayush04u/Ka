        <span>Dear Kanak,</span>
        <br />
        On this Rose Day, I just want to say that you’re genuinely special to me.
        Every petal reminds me of the small moments and conversations that stay with me longer than you might realize. I
        still remember our first conversation—it felt easy, natural, and comforting.

        I know you get busy, and sometimes replies don’t come, but that doesn’t change the fact that I think of you
        often and hope we get to talk. I really like your voice—it has a calmness that stays with me even after the call
        ends.

        I don’t expect anything more than a simple conversation, just moments where we can talk and share a little time.
        You matter to me in a way that’s quiet but sincere.

        Happy Rose Day. I hope we get many more chances to talk and create simple, good memories.
